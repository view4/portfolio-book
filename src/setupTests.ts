Review: 

So far I have made some good progress, I feel as if I have to or I want to be moving to Israel for this is something which is important to me. 
Also because it says to love the L-rd, to cleave to Him and to worship Him. I have tried hard with going freelance and put myself out there quite a bit. I do not know if I am on the cusp of succeeeding or not, but I am not earning enough money as it is and it is a little bit hard for me to feel like I can succeeed
I want to go to Israel, I feel it and it is not something which has to be permanant as it says not to eat animals without a split hoof, and also because I enjoy it there and it says to love the Lord, but it also says to resolve conflicts and to worship You, I even find it better to worship You whilst I am there, but I am struggling with my success. Neither do I have to continue freelancing whilst I am out there to be honest. 
It also says to fear You, and this is what I fear but I do not think I should neglect this and it says to connect with freedom and so I do think that there is meaning within this. 
And I do not know if I should wait, or put it off for a year, and it says to love You with all one's might, and to unify the love and fear and to resolve conflicts and I do not know if it is better to be putting this off or not. For it says to care for others, and to be fruitful, and not to steal and I think it is a bad thing that I owe this much money and so it is not something which is very straightforward for me at this moment in time. 
I do fear You and I am worried and so I do not know, it says not to make a graven image and to have faith in You and because our actions have meaning and so I think it is a good thing for me to be moving out there even if I have my fears, and to be connecting with You, and to be worshipping You through them, because I think that there is a lot of meaning which is within this as well. 
Also because I am struggling to progress with the House whilst I am here, and I also feel less happy whilst I am here and so I want to be going back to Israel, but I do not know which area or what to be doing and it does not have to be Tel-Aviv either and so it is not something which is very easy for me. It is not something which is straight-forward either. I have some freedom with where I want to go but, I do not want to be alone in all honesty 
And my only other concern is that this is actually relating to the spiritual ISrael and whilst there may well be meaning in this, if I believe in the spiritual ISrael then it is something which I should surely be connecting with and it is something which is meaningful, and it is something which I am trying to connect with in regards to my portfolio. You are my King and my God, and I do love You excessively. There is so much menaing which is in Life, but it does not mean that I should not be pursuing the physical ISrael as well because I have enjoyed it there and if anything it should be them together, and it says to walk in Your ways and not to intermarry or commit adultery and to honour one's parents and so I think it is important for me to be respectful of where I have come from. The main concern, or a main concern is being abe to earn enough money to pay rent, is to be able pay rent and live kind of independently because I cannot stay with Sammy forever and I cannot continue to be living with David and Yael, and it is hard and I am scared to get a full-time job but pehraps this is the rught thing to be doing, but also I fear it is not an easy thing to be doing either, and so I am worried and I do not know what to be doing or how to be going about this because at the moment, I am seriosuly struggling to be working eight hours a day, I am struggling with so much. 
There is many questions and concerns about how I am going to survive, but this is perhaps not the issue for here, and I think it is to be fruitful and multiply, why is it me who struggles with this so much, but it is not just me and I should continue in alignment with my beliefs. 
It is really hard but it says to love You with all one's might and I am open to getting a full-time job but I feel that freelancing may be better than me and yes I do hate how lazy I kind of feel at the moment and it is something which I really do not enjoy, and it is something which I hate and I do not understand why I am sleeping so much but I do think that tsunshine is a factor in this but waking up is something which I think would help with this and so I am worried and I do not know how to be dealing with this but there are precautions and things and cautions which I can take because it says to bind them as a sign upon your arm. 
I do not know what else to be saying, and it is not something which is very simple or easy for me, I am very worried and I do not know what will be. but I think geenrally to be focusing on and to seek to complete the portfolio which I am doing at the moment and to continue with freelancing, because it says to cleave to You, but if I am not finding things then and if it does not work out by the end of the month say, if I am still struggling with it then, then I think I should seek a full-time job because I think that it would help and it would be better for me and that it would be beneficial for me it is going to take time, and I do not like being in debt, but it says to fear You, and I think Life can be hard and it is a hard kind of industry out there but I am also wealthy in other ways I have a relatonship with God, and meaning, and Hashem is my kindness and so although I ahve been struggling with this, it says to fear You, and to love You and to cleave to You and so this is what I do hope to achieve. 
Continue pursuing moving to Israel: 
- Cleave to Him 
- Honour your parents 
- Not to intermarry 

Building the portfolio: 
- is in order to aid my freelancing, it is aligned with my beliefs. 
- be fruitful 
- cleave to Him 
- Fear the L-rd.. 

Continue coding in alignment with my beliefs, values and relationship with God: 
- fear Him 
- Eat be sated and bless Him 
- Tech can be used for good. 
- have a relationship with Life. 
- Be fruitful 
- I think it can help me to learn new things and to develop/portfolio repoitoire of skills
---> Especially in a way which is good for my relationship with Life: 
- Have a relationship with Life
- connect with meaning


Be proactive in regards to waking up: 
- fear Him 
- cleave to Him 
- Speak of them 
Bind them as a sign 
- Let in consciousness
- it is something which is not completely me, but also something which is not pleasant  and can honder Life.
