  "about-me": {
    "snippet": "Despite gaining much from university, after graduating it was time for change and a new challenge. This partially came in the form of learning to code. After many hours of independent learning, some internship experience an intensive bootcamp and several freelance projects, a mound of professional and technical understanding has been gained- and there's still so much more to learn and create.",
    "values": "That which is valued in Life can determine so much of who we are. It is personally felt important to bring such fundamental parts of ourselves into everything we do, including our work. Doing so can encourage passion, pride and fulfillment ",
    "likes": "Whilst programming is enjoyable, fulfilling and a personal passion, other hobbies include - writing, cooking, exercising, socialising and listening to music."

  "education": {
    "intro": " \"Rome was not built in a day\" and a good developer is not created overnight. Progress and achievement attained often came with struggle and hard work.",
    "selfTaught": "The beginning was probably the hardest part. Entering the unknown without much guidance was difficult. However after hours and hours of working through free online content, doing courses and attending multiple meetups, a fairly solid foundation was created. It also became clear how much there was to truly learn, and that often the best way to grow is through independent learning.",
    "bootcamp": "The course was great. It was fun, it was difficult, it was stressfull, it was challenging all rolled into one. The days were long about ten to twelve hours onsite and they tried to cram as much into us as possible teaching us - front-end (HTML/CSS, Javascript, Jquery, React & responsive design), back-end (Python, Django, SQL) and git. There were some great people and we all learnt and gained so much through it.  ",
    "internship": "The second half of the bootcamp was a professional internship, gaving a real taste of the industry. The main challenges were adapting to the size of the code base, working heavily with other people's code and maintaining high quality code. During these two months, experience writing code in a professional setting was gained. Internship technolgies used include React, React-redux, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Docker, Git, Madrill. ",
